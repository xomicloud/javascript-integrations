# JavaScript Integrations

Integrations written in JavaScript.

Instructions for getting these up and running locally can be found in the [Google Drive integration tutorial](https://developers.xomi.cloud/tutorial/google-drive-integration) The instructions given below are somewhat brief, the tutorial is your bast bet.

## Installation

You can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/xomicloud/javascript-integrations.git

...and then install the dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

These integrations must be configured before it can be run, which requires a corresponding Xomi client. Again, please see the tutorial.
